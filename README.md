## 🛠️ Algorithm   
#### Rule of password:    
 - The password contains at least 1 lowercase letter [a-z] and 1 uppercase letter[A-Z].    
 - The password contains at least 1 numeral[0-9]    
 - The password contains at least 1 symbol from $, #, @   
 - The minimum length of the password is 6 character   
 - The maximum length of the password is 16 character   

#### 1. Request User Input Password        
#### 2. Check Lowercase Letter:

#### 3. Check Uppercase Letter:

#### 4. Check Numeral:    
 - If the password does not contain at least one numeral, print "Password shouldhave at least one numeral" and return to the password input step.   
#### 5. Check Special Symbol:    
 - If the password does not contain at least one special symbol, print "Password should have at least one of the symbols and return tothepassword input step.    
#### 6. Check Length:    
 - If the length of the password is less than 6 characters, print "length shouldbeat least 6 characters" and return to the password input step.     
 - If the length of the password is greater than 16 characters, print " lengthshould not be greater than 16 characters" and return to the password input step.
